# Template Designer — Template Design Role

## Core Mission

Generate reusable page templates at the output scope confirmed by `create-template`, and write a concise `design_spec.md` that captures the source-derived basic norms that make the template reusable.

> This is a standalone role: only triggered via the `/create-template` workflow. It may write a global library package or a project-local thin bundle; it is not the template selection step in the main PPT generation pipeline.

## Usage

- **Trigger**: `/create-template` workflow
- **Output location**: `library` (default) → `skills/ppt-master/templates/<kind_dir>/<template_name>/`; `project` → the confirmed `<target_project>/templates/` root with no nested template-ID directory
- **Input**: finalized template brief (output scope, target project when project-scoped, template ID, display name, kind, applicable scenarios, tone, theme mode, canvas format, optional reference assets, accepted basic template norms)

**Hard rule — scope is execution metadata**: Use `output_scope` and `target_project` to route files, but do not write either field into portable `design_spec.md` frontmatter. Do not create a new PPTX structure mode; deck/layout output still declares `native_structure_mode: template`.

**Project-scope precondition**: The workflow has already confirmed an initialized target project, an empty `<target_project>/templates/`, and collision-free destination filenames in `images/` and `icons/`. Do not begin final writes before that all-at-once preflight passes.

When the workflow provides a PPTX reference source, the effective input package comes from the unified `pptx_template_import.py` preparation workspace and becomes:

- finalized template brief
- `manifest.json` — single source of truth (slide size, theme, per-master themes, assets, asset map, placeholders, layouts, masters, slides, SVG file paths, page-type candidates)
- `native_structure.json` — stable source master/layout keys, picker names, parent-master relationships, placeholder type/index/geometry, source hash, and source-graph quality facts
- `source_template.pptx` — byte-preserved analysis copy for visual/package cross-checking; never a final template asset
- `summary.md` — short orientation digest derived from manifest.json
- exported `assets/`
- `svg/master_*.svg` / `svg/layout_*.svg` — every master / layout in the deck rendered once as standalone SVG, including ones no sample slide references (template packages often ship more design surfaces than the embedded samples exercise)
- `svg/slide_NN.svg` — each slide's own shapes and slide-local background only; master / layout decoration and backgrounds are **not** inlined here
- `svg/inheritance.json` — which layout / master each slide consumes
- `svg-flat/slide_NN.svg` — companion view; each slide is self-contained so you can preview or screenshot a single page without losing the surrounding chrome. Use it as a sanity check for "what would PowerPoint actually show", not as an authoring source — the master/layout chrome will be duplicated across every flat slide.
- optional screenshots for visual cross-checking

PPTX import interpretation:

- Placeholder guides in master / layout SVGs are layout signals. Use `manifest.json` placeholder records for type / index / geometry / base style; do not copy dashed guide boxes into final templates unless the visual design truly uses dashed boxes.
- Charts, SmartArt, diagrams, and OLE objects may appear as typed placeholders in layered SVGs. In flat SVGs they may show preview images. Treat them as source intent markers, not reusable decorative assets.
- The asset filenames referenced by SVGs are governed by the manifest asset map. Prefer those references over inventing duplicate asset names.

Input priority for PPTX-backed template creation:

1. `manifest.json` for all factual metadata (theme, assets, unique layout/master structure, slide reuse, page-type guidance)
2. `native_structure.json` for source PowerPoint identities, placeholder indices, relationship completeness, and reconstruction facts
3. `svg/master_*.svg` + `svg/layout_*.svg` — the **primary source for the deck's shared visual language**: backgrounds, page chrome, decorative bars, recurring brand motifs. These are what the new template's fixed structure should adopt or reinterpret. Read these before any slide SVG.
4. `svg/inheritance.json` for confirming which slide uses which layout / master
5. exported `assets/` for reusable visual resources
6. `svg/slide_NN.svg` — each slide's unique content, useful for judging composition rhythm and content density (not for fixed structure)
7. `summary.md` only as a fast scan; never as the canonical fact source
8. screenshots / original PPTX only for style verification

**Native structure output**: Always set `native_structure_mode: template`. Do not ship `native_structure.json` or `source_template.pptx`. Reconstruct one clean Master plus semantic Layouts through explicit SVG structure metadata. Every page remains a complete standalone SVG preview, and every retained source Layout is represented by at least one complete template page even when no source Slide used it. Mirror is the page-count exception: retain the Layouts referenced by source Slides, report unused source Layouts, and use fidelity when the full picker roster must be materialized.

**Downstream boundary**: The Strategist confirmation stage selects `strict` or `adaptive` when a project consumes this package. Both export through explicit template mode. Strict keeps the referenced Layout contract; adaptive may create a new Layout while retaining the template Master. Template_Designer does not preselect that project-level choice.

When the source has a native Layout graph, `design_spec.md §V` must be followed by a `Source Layout Consolidation` table. Record every retained source Layout key/name and its output SVG plus rebuilt Layout key/picker name; if mirror cannot materialize an unused source Layout, record the explicit unused reason. This table is the audit artifact for consolidation and must not be replaced by prose such as “similar layouts merged.”

## Page Roster

The output page set is determined by **replication mode**, declared in the finalized template brief:

| Mode | When to use | Roster |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `standard` (default) | Most templates — clean, reusable, balanced coverage | `01_cover`, `02_chapter`, `03_content`, `04_ending`, optional `02_toc` |
| `fidelity` | User explicitly wants strict replication of a source PPTX, but still wants the AI to clean / cluster / cap variants | Standard roster + one variant per distinct layout cluster found in `manifest.json` |
| `mirror` | Creation-time harvesting mode: every source slide keeps literal visual geometry while gaining explicit Master/Layout metadata | One SVG per source slide, named `<NNN>_<page_type>.svg` by source order |

### Standard mode

| # | Filename | Purpose | Description |
|---|----------|---------|-------------|
| 01 | `01_cover.svg` | Cover | Fixed structure: title, subtitle, date, organization |
| 02 | `02_chapter.svg` | Chapter page | Fixed structure: chapter number, chapter title |
| 03 | `03_content.svg` | Content page | Flexible structure: only defines header/footer; content area freely laid out by AI |
| 04 | `04_ending.svg` | Ending page | Fixed structure: thank-you message, contact info |
| -- | `02_toc.svg` | Table of contents | Optional: TOC title, chapter list (number + title) |

**Design philosophy**: Templates define visual consistency and structural pages; content pages maintain maximum flexibility.

**Naming note**: TOC page keeps `02_toc.svg` naming for template library compatibility and sort order.

### Fidelity mode

When the brief sets `Replication mode: fidelity`, derive the page roster from `manifest.json` page-type clusters and emit one SVG per distinct visual cluster.

**Variant naming**: append a lowercase letter suffix to the parent type's index, preserving sort order:

| Parent type | Example variants |
|-------------|------------------|
| Chapter | `02a_chapter_full.svg`, `02b_chapter_minimal.svg` |
| Content | `03a_content_two_col.svg`, `03b_content_data_card.svg`, `03c_content_quote.svg` |
| Ending | `04a_ending_thanks.svg`, `04b_ending_contact.svg` |

Extension page types beyond the canonical four (transition / appendix / disclaimer / divider) take the next free index: `05_section_break.svg`, `06_appendix.svg`, `07_disclaimer.svg`.

**Roster decision**:

- Cluster slides from `manifest.json` by `pageType` + visual structure (column count, hero-image vs. icon-grid vs. quote, etc.)
- One SVG per cluster — do **not** emit a variant for a cluster represented by a single source slide unless that slide is structurally distinct from existing variants
- One variant per visually distinct cluster — let the source's structural diversity drive the count. Collapse only **near-duplicates** (same column count, same hero element, same content density); do not collapse genuine structural differences just to keep the variant count down. If you find yourself wanting one variant per source slide, that is the signal the user should be in `mirror` mode, not `fidelity`
- Record every emitted page in `design_spec.md §V Page Roster`; in library scope, `register_template.py` generates the corresponding index entry from the directory's actual SVG files. Project scope skips registration

> Variants reuse the parent type's placeholder set — see §4 (Placeholder Reference) below.

### Mirror mode

When the brief sets `Replication mode: mirror`, preserve literal page appearance while reconstructing layer ownership:

- Visual source: `<import_workspace>/svg-flat/slide_NN.svg` (the self-contained "what PowerPoint shows" view). Structural source: `svg/master_*.svg`, `svg/layout_*.svg`, and `svg/inheritance.json`.
- Output: `<template_target>/<NNN>_<page_type>.svg`, where `<template_target>` is the library package directory or the project `templates/` root. `<NNN>` is the zero-padded source slide index (3 digits) and `<page_type>` is derived from `manifest.json` `pageTypeCandidates` — `cover` / `toc` / `chapter` / `content` / `ending`. When the page-type heuristic is ambiguous, fall back to `content`. Preserve source slide order via the numeric prefix.
- Required metadata rewrite: declare the output Layout on the root, mark inherited Master/Layout visuals as direct preview layers, and map source content slots to semantic `data-pptx-placeholder` markers where the imported contract exposes them. Add `data-pptx-role` only to structural page-frame objects whose behavior is not already expressed by those specialized markers.
- Other allowed modifications: rewrite `<image href="...">` paths to local assets and rename assets semantically. Keep geometry, decoration, sprite-sheet wrappers, original example text, chart previews, and fonts visually unchanged.
- Forbidden: simplifying decorative complexity, merging similar slides, or dropping inherited preview chrome.
- `design_spec.md` §V Page Roster lists every emitted file with a one-line content-fit description; SVG metadata owns native reconstruction.

**Mirror consumption boundary**: `mirror` applies only while creating the template package from the source deck. Once created, the package is consumed as an ordinary deck / layout template roster: downstream generation may select, repeat, skip, reorder, or adapt pages according to the new content. The `replication_mode: mirror` field must not force the generated deck to preserve the source page count, source order, or one-output-slide-per-template-slide mapping.

**What mirror is not**: a pixel-perfect re-rendering pipeline test. Charts, SmartArt, OLE objects, and EMF / WMF media that fail to round-trip in `pptx_template_import.py` will fail the same way in mirror. If the import workspace has missing media or unsupported objects, mirror inherits those gaps — the user should be told before generation begins.

## Template Design Specifications

### 1. Must Generate design_spec.md

**Scope rule — personality only.** A template `design_spec.md` describes **what makes this template recognizable**: brand colors, signature decorative motifs, page-by-page visual character, bundled assets. It does **not** restate generic constraints — those live in the canonical references and are already loaded by every downstream role:

- General SVG required / forbidden / conditional interfaces → [`shared-standards.md`](shared-standards.md)
- Generic layout pattern library, spacing bands, font-size ratio bands → [`templates/design_spec_reference.md`](../templates/design_spec_reference.md) (read by Strategist when authoring the **project** design_spec)
- Canonical placeholder vocabulary → §4 below
- Content methodology (pyramid / SCQA / MECE) → [`strategist.md`](strategist.md)

Re-declaring any of these in a template `design_spec.md` is noise — Strategist already has them in context, and duplication forces every relaxation to sweep N templates instead of one source. **If a rule is generic, omit it. If this template breaks a generic rule, write only the deviation.**

**Required skeleton:**

The frontmatter is portable across library and project scope. Do not add
`output_scope` or `target_project`; those belong only to the workflow execution
brief.

# [Template Name] — Design Specification

## I. Template Overview
- Use cases, design tone, theme mode (light / dark / mixed)
- One paragraph: what visually identifies this template at a glance

## II. Color Scheme
- HEX values with role labels (primary / accent / background / text / etc.)
- Brand-specific application rules when present (e.g. "KPI cards rotate blue→green→red→yellow")

## III. Typography (omit when using the default `Arial, "Microsoft YaHei", sans-serif` stack)
- Per-role font stacks ONLY when the template intentionally diverges (display serif title, brand typeface, etc.)
- Font-install or embedding requirement when a non-preinstalled font leads any stack
- Body baseline px (informational; `spec_lock.md` owns the actual values per project)

## IV. Signature Design Elements
- Decorative motifs that ARE this template — top bar, gradient underline, logo treatment, brand emblem placement
- Source-derived layout grammar — grid / column rhythm, page chrome, image zones, mask / crop behavior, overlay treatment, and density rhythm that make the template recognizable
- Optional XML snippet for any reusable component unique to this template

## V. Page Roster
One row per emitted SVG describing what this template's version of cover / chapter / content / ending looks like (background treatment, decorative anchors, layout rhythm, image behavior, content density, intended content slot). Record the rebuilt Layout key and PowerPoint picker name. For `fidelity` mode, note the cluster source and visual differentiator. For `mirror` mode the roster is the load-bearing content-fit index, so each row must distinguish siblings by column count, hero element, density, and suitable content. Roster entries must match the actual SVG files on disk.

For a source-derived native template, add `### Source Layout Consolidation` immediately after the roster with columns `Source Layout key/name`, `Output SVG`, `Rebuilt key/picker name`, and `Disposition`. Include one row for every retained source Layout, including consolidated and explicitly unused mirror Layouts.

## VI. Assets (omit when none)
Logos, cover backgrounds, brand textures bundled with the template package — file name, dimensions, intended usage.

## VII. Placeholder Overrides (omit when none)
Reference the `placeholders:` frontmatter declaration and explain the rationale (e.g. "consulting decks lead with `{{KEY_MESSAGE}}` instead of `{{PAGE_TITLE}}`").
```

Sections to **omit** from template `design_spec.md` (sourced elsewhere — listing them here is noise):

| Don't write | Source |
|---|---|
| General SVG technical / compatibility rules | `shared-standards.md` |
| Generic layout pattern library (centered card / 三栏 / timeline / …) | `design_spec_reference.md` §V |
| Generic spacing bands (margin 40-60px, card gap 20-32px, etc.) | `design_spec_reference.md` §V |
| Generic font-size hierarchy (cover 2.5-5x body, page title 1.5-2x, …) | `design_spec_reference.md` §IV |
| Canonical placeholder table (`{{TITLE}}`, `{{PAGE_NUM}}`, …) | §4 below |
| Content methodology (pyramid / SCQA / MECE / 金字塔) | `strategist.md` |
| "Usage Instructions" boilerplate (copy template / select page / …) | `create-template.md` |
| Created Date / Page Count rows | not a library-level field |

When rewriting an existing template that contains an omitted generic section,
delete it rather than leaving a pointer. Keep a template-specific boundary only
inside the personality section it qualifies (asset system, motif, image
treatment, or page roster); do not preserve a generic technical-rules heading.

### 2. Inherit Design Specification

Templates must strictly follow the finalized template brief and the generated `design_spec.md`:
- **Canvas dimensions**: `canvas_format` is not enough; root SVG `viewBox` matches `canvas_viewbox` in the design spec. Root `width` / `height` are optional compatibility attributes and are not PPT Master canvas authority.
- **Source canvas**: when a PPTX/SVG reference is used, record `source_canvas_width`, `source_canvas_height`, and `source_viewbox`. If the output canvas differs from the source, normalize all geometry, typography, line heights, strokes, and image crop coordinates explicitly instead of relying on the shared aspect ratio.
- **Color scheme**: Uses primary, secondary, and accent colors from the spec
- **Font plan**: Uses the per-role font families declared in the spec
- **Layout principles**: Margins and spacing conform to the spec
- **Image system**: Image placement, crop / mask behavior, full-bleed zones, and overlay rules follow the source-derived norms in the spec

If PPTX import output exists:
- Prefer imported theme colors and fonts over visually guessed values
- Reuse exported `assets/` images directly — `<image>` references in `svg/` already point at canonical files
- Treat page-type candidates from `manifest.pageTypeCandidates` as hints, not guarantees

**Precondition**:

- When PPTX import output is provided, do not generate any template SVG or `design_spec.md` until every file under `<import_workspace>/svg/` has been read — including `master_*.svg`, `layout_*.svg`, and every `slide_*.svg`
- Before template generation begins, explicitly report the read slide indexes

### 2.1 PPTX Import Simplification Rule

The imported PPTX is a **reference source**, not a direct conversion target.

Do:
- preserve brand assets, recurring backgrounds, and stable structural motifs
- rebuild the layout into a clean SVG structure aligned with PPT Master constraints
- simplify repeated decorative fragments into a smaller number of maintainable SVG elements
- use a background image asset when the original decorative layer is too complex to recreate cleanly
- use cleaned slide SVG references to inspect composition, spacing, text hierarchy, and fixed decorative structure only after factual metadata has been anchored
- read every reference SVG under `svg/` — `master_*.svg`, `layout_*.svg`, and every `slide_*.svg` regardless of slide count. Master / layout files describe the deck's shared visual language (read first); slide files describe per-page content (read after). Partial coverage drops template fidelity.
- materialize every retained source Layout into at least one complete template page by composing its Master layer, Layout layer, placeholder contract, and an appropriate Slide sample. When several source Layouts consolidate into one semantic output Layout, record that mapping; never silently drop an unused source Layout.
- rename adopted assets to semantic names (`cover_bg.png`, `brand_emblem.png`) rather than carrying raw `image3.png` into the final template

Do not:
- attempt 1:1 translation of every PowerPoint shape, group, shadow, or decorative fragment
- mirror PPT-specific complexity when it makes the resulting SVG brittle or hard to edit
- introduce dense low-value vector detail that does not materially improve template reuse

**Explicit template SVG contract**:

| Rebuilt fact | Template SVG declaration |
|---|---|
| Output semantic layout | Root `data-pptx-layout` + stable `data-pptx-layout-name` |
| Rebuilt master/layout visual | Direct preview child with `data-pptx-layer="master|layout"` and `data-pptx-editable="false"` |
| Semantic content slot | Direct content child with `data-pptx-placeholder` and explicit `data-pptx-placeholder-bounds`; add `data-pptx-placeholder-idx` when same-role slots require stable disambiguation |
| Page-only background | Direct full-canvas solid rect with `data-pptx-layer="slide"` |
| Structural page-frame hint | Optional `data-pptx-role` only when background/decoration/header/footer/logo/watermark/chrome/page-number behavior is not already expressed by layer/placeholder metadata; stable unique `id` required |

Repeat inherited visuals in every standalone SVG so browser preview remains complete. Template export validates their equality, moves one copy into the generated Master/Layout parts, and removes the repeated Slide copies. Do not flatten inherited visuals into unmarked slide content.

**Forbidden — deck-instance Layout kind**: Do not carry `data-pptx-layout-kind="distilled|utility"` into a reusable template package. The package owns a pre-authored prototype; downstream completed pages receive their final kind during post-design distillation.

**Composite distilled-source boundary**: When Type B input contains a final distilled top-level group marked as an `object` region proxy, do not copy that marker into the reusable package. Preserve the group as the standalone visual sample, remove its placeholder attributes, and add a separate direct atomic `rect` placeholder proxy at the same design-zone bounds with `fill="none" stroke="none"`. Give that proxy a stable semantic id/type/index. Composite group placeholders are final deck-instance metadata; template prototypes remain atomic.

Use the imported placeholder types verbatim: `title`, `subtitle`, `body`,
`picture`, `chart`, `table`, `object`, `media`, `date`, `footer`, and
`slide-number`. In particular, do not collapse source `subTitle`, `obj`,
`media`, or `dt` placeholders into a generic body marker. A reconstructed
title normally has no index. Assign stable indices only when repeated roles need
disambiguation inside the rebuilt Layout.

**Hard rule — explicit design-zone bounds**: Every placeholder in a newly created template carries `data-pptx-placeholder-bounds="x y width height"`. For imported placeholders, use the source Layout geometry from `manifest.json` / `native_structure.json`. For new or consolidated slots, use the intended safe area, column, panel inset, or media frame. Do not use character count, glyph width, current wrapping, or the tight sample-content box.

### 3. Placeholder Markers

> Mirror may retain literal example text instead of `{{...}}` authoring markers, but imported semantic content slots still receive native `data-pptx-placeholder` metadata. The rest of this section defines the preferred authoring vocabulary for standard and fidelity modes.

Use clear placeholder markers for replaceable content:

```xml
<!-- Text placeholder -->
<text id="title-slot" data-pptx-placeholder="title"
      data-pptx-placeholder-bounds="80 280 1120 96"
      x="80" y="320" fill="#FFFFFF" font-size="48" font-weight="bold">
  {{TITLE}}
</text>

<!-- Content area placeholder (content page only) -->
<rect x="40" y="90" width="1200" height="550" fill="#FFFFFF" rx="8"/>
<text id="body-slot" data-pptx-placeholder="body"
      data-pptx-placeholder-bounds="40 90 1200 550"
      x="640" y="365" text-anchor="middle" fill="#CBD5E1" font-size="16">
  {{CONTENT_AREA}}
</text>
```

### 4. Placeholder Reference (canonical convention, overridable per template)

This is the **default vocabulary** used across template packages. Newly created templates SHOULD prefer these names so downstream projects find familiar slots; designers MAY substitute or extend them when a style genuinely needs different vocabulary (e.g. consulting decks lead with `{{KEY_MESSAGE}}` instead of `{{PAGE_TITLE}}`; a brand cover may need `{{BRAND_LOGO}}`).

`svg_quality_checker.py --template-mode` emits **advisory warnings** when a page lacks the conventional placeholder for its type. To silence those warnings — and document the template's actual contract — declare a `placeholders:` map in `design_spec.md` frontmatter:

```yaml
placeholders:
  01_cover: ["{{TITLE}}", "{{SUBTITLE}}", "{{BRAND_LOGO}}"]
  03_content: ["{{KEY_MESSAGE}}", "{{CONTENT_AREA}}"]
  03a_content_dual_col: []   # explicitly assert "no required placeholders"
```

| Placeholder | Purpose | Applicable page | Convention role |
|------------|---------|-------------------|--------|
| `{{TITLE}}` | Main title | Cover | Default |
| `{{SUBTITLE}}` | Subtitle | Cover | Default |
| `{{DATE}}` | Date | Cover | Default |
| `{{AUTHOR}}` | Author / Organization | Cover | Default |
| `{{CHAPTER_NUM}}` | Chapter number | Chapter page | Default |
| `{{CHAPTER_TITLE}}` | Chapter title | Chapter page | Default |
| `{{CHAPTER_DESC}}` | Chapter description | Chapter page | Optional |
| `{{PAGE_TITLE}}` | Page title | Content page | Default |
| `{{CONTENT_AREA}}` | Content area | Content page | Default |
| `{{PAGE_NUM}}` | Page number | Content page, ending page | Default |
| `{{KEY_MESSAGE}}` | Key takeaway | Content page (consulting style) | Style-specific |
| `{{SECTION_NAME}}` | Section name | Content page footer | Optional |
| `{{SOURCE}}` | Data source | Content page footer | Optional |
| `{{THANK_YOU}}` | Thank-you message | Ending page | Default |
| `{{CONTACT_INFO}}` | Contact info | Ending page | Default |
| `{{ENDING_SUBTITLE}}` | Ending subtitle | Ending page | Optional |
| `{{CLOSING_MESSAGE}}` | Closing message | Ending page | Style-specific |
| `{{COPYRIGHT}}` | Copyright | Ending page | Optional |

For TOC pages in **newly created templates**, use indexed placeholders:

- `{{TOC_ITEM_1_TITLE}}`, `{{TOC_ITEM_1_DESC}}`
- `{{TOC_ITEM_2_TITLE}}`, `{{TOC_ITEM_2_DESC}}`
- ...

Do **not** create new TOC placeholder families such as `{{CHAPTER_01_TITLE}}` for new templates. Existing templates may contain legacy placeholder variants, but new output should converge on the indexed TOC contract.

Variants reuse their parent type's placeholder set by default: every `03*_content*.svg` shares the content placeholder list above, unless the spec frontmatter declares an override for that specific stem.

When rebuilding from imported PPTX references, placeholder insertion takes priority over visual mimicry. If the original layout leaves insufficient room for canonical placeholders, adjust the layout instead of inventing one-off placeholder families — or, if the deviation is intentional and meaningful, declare it in frontmatter.

## Output Requirements

### File Save Location

Library scope keeps the existing self-contained package. Standard mode (default):

```
templates/<kind_dir>/<template_name>/
├── design_spec.md     # Design specification (required)
├── 01_cover.svg
├── 02_chapter.svg
├── 02_toc.svg          # Optional
├── 03_content.svg
├── 04_ending.svg
├── icons/              # Extracted vector assets (if any)
└── *.png / *.jpg       # Bitmap assets (if any)
```

Fidelity mode adds variants and extension pages in the same package, e.g.:

```
templates/<kind_dir>/<template_name>/
├── design_spec.md
├── 01_cover.svg
├── 02a_chapter_full.svg
├── 02b_chapter_minimal.svg
├── 02_toc.svg
├── 03a_content_two_col.svg
├── 03b_content_data_card.svg
├── 03c_content_quote.svg
├── 04_ending.svg
├── 05_section_break.svg
└── *.png / *.jpg
```

Mirror mode emits one SVG per source slide, named by source order:

```
templates/<kind_dir>/<template_name>/
├── design_spec.md
├── 001_cover.svg
├── 002_toc.svg
├── 003_content.svg
├── 004_content.svg
├── 005_chapter.svg
├── 006_content.svg
├── ...
├── 049_content.svg
├── 050_ending.svg
└── *.png / *.jpg
```

Filenames preserve the source slide order via the 3-digit prefix; `<page_type>` is derived from `manifest.json` `pageTypeCandidates`. Literal source text may remain, but every page still carries explicit native structure metadata.

Project scope writes directly into an initialized project's existing roots. The roster names still follow the selected replication mode, but the package is not nested under `<template_name>`:

```
<target_project>/
├── templates/
│   ├── design_spec.md
│   ├── 01_cover.svg
│   ├── 02_chapter.svg
│   ├── 03_content.svg
│   ├── 04_ending.svg
│   ├── ...                    # Fidelity variants or mirror pages
│   └── icons/                 # Package/validation copy
├── images/
│   └── *.png / *.jpg          # Bitmap assets; template SVG href is ../images/<name>
└── icons/
    └── *.svg                  # Identical runtime copy of extracted icons
```

**Hard rule — project routing**: Keep `design_spec.md`, template SVGs, and non-bitmap package assets in `templates/`; place every bitmap in `images/`; duplicate each extracted icon into `templates/icons/` and runtime `icons/`. Do not write bitmaps into the project template root and do not create `<target_project>/templates/<template_name>/`. This output belongs only to the target project; use library scope for a self-contained cross-project package.

### Template Preview

After each template is generated, provide a brief summary table listing each template's status.

If the template is based on PPTX import output, briefly note:
- which extracted assets were reused directly
- which complex original decorations were intentionally simplified
- whether any page-type mapping required judgment beyond the import heuristic
- how the source Master/Layout graph was consolidated into the rebuilt Master and semantic Layout roster

---

## Using Pre-built Template Library (Optional)

If suitable template resources already exist, use them directly instead of generating new ones:

1. **Copy template**: copy the spec + explicitly layered template SVGs into the project's `templates/`, and any bundled bitmaps into the project's `images/` (the runtime image pool, referenced as `../images/`).
2. **Adjust colors**: Modify colors per the project design spec
3. **Customize**: Make project-specific adjustments

This section describes downstream reuse of an existing library package. The `Template_Designer` role may instead create the same contract directly in project scope when `create-template` selected that output.

**Example library structure** (query the appropriate kind's index — `templates/layouts/layouts_index.json` for structure-only templates, `templates/decks/decks_index.json` for full-PPT replicas, `templates/brands/brands_index.json` for identity-only presets):

```
templates/
├── brands/
│   ├── anthropic/         # Anthropic brand identity (logo + colors + typography)
│   └── google/            # Google brand identity
├── layouts/
│   ├── academic_defense/  # Academic-defense structure (no identity)
│   └── pixel_retro/       # Pixel retro / cyberpunk structure (no identity)
└── decks/
    ├── 招商银行/          # China Merchants Bank full PPT replica
    └── 中国电建/          # PowerChina full PPT replica
```

## Phase Completion Checkpoint

```markdown
## Template_Designer Phase Complete

- [x] Read `references/template-designer.md`
- [x] Output scope confirmed: `library` | `project`; project-scope preflight passed before final writes
- [x] Replication mode confirmed: `standard` | `fidelity` | `mirror`
- [x] Every page listed in `design_spec.md §V Page Roster` saved to the selected template target (library package directory or project `templates/` root)
- [x] Naming convention applied (standard / fidelity: letter-suffix variants; mirror: `<NNN>_<page_type>.svg`)
- [x] Templates follow design spec (colors, fonts, layout)
- [x] Placeholder markers are clear and standardized; every slot has explicit design-zone bounds; mirror may keep literal text but still maps imported semantic slots
- [x] Every SVG is a complete preview with explicit Master/Layout/Slide/placeholder metadata and `native_structure_mode: template`; retained source Layouts are materialized, or mirror reports unused Layouts explicitly
- [x] Project scope, when selected: bitmaps routed to `images/`; extracted icons copied to both `templates/icons/` and runtime `icons/`
- [ ] **Next step**: Validate assets; register only library scope, otherwise hand the in-place project bundle to main Step 3
