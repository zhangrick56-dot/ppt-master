# Executor Common Guidelines

> Narrative skeleton and visual aesthetic come from this deck's locked files under [`modes/`](./modes/_index.md) and [`visual-styles/`](./visual-styles/_index.md). Technical constraints are in shared-standards.md.

**Hard rule — complete page SVG**: Every visible object intended for the exported slide MUST exist in the final page SVG or be explicitly referenced by it. Templates and `spec_lock.md` guide construction; they are not export-time overlays for missing visible content.

**Hard rule — minimal semantics without semantic loss**: Any page with a locked `pptx_layouts` row declares `data-pptx-layout` and `data-pptx-layout-name` on the root and does not duplicate that identity with `data-pptx-page-role`. Free-design and brand-only baseline pages normally have no mapping while their visual composition is being authored; keep structure metadata absent until the user explicitly runs [`distill-layouts`](../workflows/distill-layouts.md). Add `data-pptx-role` only to structural page-frame objects whose package, page-number, or animation behavior is not already expressed by layer, placeholder, or native-object metadata; the marked element uses a stable unique `id`. Ordinary page content keeps normal SVG structure without duplicate semantic classification. See [`semantic-svg.md`](./semantic-svg.md).

**Hard rule — supported PPTX route**: The only supported generated-PPTX path is `svg_output/` through the project SVG-to-DrawingML converter. Step 7.2 still generates `svg_final/` as a mandatory self-contained visual preview that may be inserted as an SVG picture. Do not treat PowerPoint's manual Convert-to-Shape operation as an authoring target or compatibility requirement.

> Note: this rule covers page design only. Speaker notes, animations, transitions, narration, and direct native-PPTX workflows retain their separate artifacts and package-level processing.

## 1. Template Adherence Rules

### 1.0 Pre-generation Batch Read

**Hard rule**: Before the first SVG page, batch-read every template SVG this deck will reference. Read once up front, never re-read during generation.

| Source list | Read path |
|---|---|
| Chosen template's `design_spec.md` (read frontmatter to detect `replication_mode`) | `templates/design_spec.md` |
| Legacy preserve-mode native layout/placeholder contract, when present | `templates/native_structure.json` |
| Every distinct `<basename>` in `spec_lock.md page_layouts` | `templates/<basename>.svg` |
| Every distinct chart name in `spec_lock.md page_charts` | `templates/charts/<chart_name>.svg` |
| Chart types in `design_spec.md §VII` not covered above | `templates/charts/<chart_name>.svg` |

**Default — read each template once; re-read only on the mid-deck exception below**:
- Layout SVG already loaded in this batch
- Chart SVG already loaded in this batch

`spec_lock.md` is the only file re-read per page (§2.1).

**Exception**: user mid-deck adds pages or swaps templates introducing a basename/chart absent from the original batch → read the new file once, continue.

> Note: batched prefix reads stay in the cached prompt prefix; per-page `spec_lock.md` re-reads append below and benefit from that cache. Scattered on-demand reads of layout/chart SVGs would invalidate downstream cache and sit in the compression-vulnerable mid-context region.

Resolve the per-page template SVG via `spec_lock.md page_layouts` (authoritative). The legacy page-type table below is a **last-resort fallback** for legacy decks where `page_layouts` is missing.

**Resolution order (per page):**

1. **Mirror-mode template** (template's `design_spec.md` frontmatter has `replication_mode: mirror`) → see §1.1 below. The page is consumed as a **visual reference**, not as a placeholder shell.
2. `spec_lock.md page_layouts` has `P<NN>: <basename>` for this page → inherit the structure of `templates/<basename>.svg` (already in context from §1.0).
3. `pptx_structure.mode: template` but this page has no `page_layouts` entry → stop; the template contract is incomplete. Adaptive mode must still select a reference SVG.
4. `page_layouts` section absent in a legacy project and `templates/` exists → fall back to the page-type table below, matching by SVG filename keyword. Read the matched file at first use if §1.0 did not cover it.
5. No deck/layout template at all → free design.

> Note: `page_layouts` disambiguates the multiple content variants modern templates ship (e.g., `graduation_defense` has 8); the legacy table cannot.

**Templates supply structure, not skin (non-mirror)**: a chart or layout template's gradients, drop-shadows, palette, **and font sizes** are placeholder. Inherit its geometry, label / legend placement, and series-encoding logic; re-skin every fill / stroke to the deck's `visual_style` + `spec_lock.colors` — flat styles strip the gradients and shadows, gradient / glass styles repaint their own. Forbidden — shipping a template's default `<linearGradient>` / `cardShadow` / Tailwind fills unchanged. Mirror templates are the exception: §1.1 preserves their visuals verbatim.

**Font size is skin, not geometry (non-mirror).** A chart / layout template's hardcoded `font-size` values (often 11–16px, sized for the template's own dense placeholder text) are NOT inherited — classify each text into its `spec_lock.md` role and use that role's locked size, exactly as you re-skin color. **Structural roles (page title / body / subtitle / annotation / footnote) hold their one deck-wide size on every page** — the template's placeholder px never overrides it; same-role text drifting page to page is what makes a deck look unprofessional.

**Typography execution order (mandatory):**

1. Build a per-page text inventory from `design_spec.md §IX` + the current `notes/<NN>_*.md`.
2. Classify each text item before drawing. **Structural roles** (`title`, `subtitle` / `lead`, `body`, `annotation`, `footnote` / `page_number`) must map to their declared `spec_lock.typography` slot. A **one-off feature element** (a single hero number, an isolated emphasis label) may take an in-ramp intermediate value — the ramp is anchored on `body`, not a closed menu — but a feature size that **recurs** must be promoted to a declared slot. The failure mode this guards against is structural text silently inheriting the template's compact px, not legitimate feature sizing.
3. Copy the role's locked px value into `font-size` verbatim. Do this before placing the text; never start from a template `font-size` and then "adjust".
4. Layout from those locked sizes: compute line-height, wrapped line count, child `y` / `dy`, card padding, card height, column gaps, and available image/chart area from the chosen px values.
5. Only after this reflow may you inspect fit. If fit fails, move / resize containers or simplify local geometry first; do not reduce the role size merely because the inherited template slot was smaller.

**Geometry adapts to the type, never the reverse**: when the locked size is larger than the template's placeholder text, widen / heighten the card, open spacing, and recompute child `y` / `dy` to make room — do not shrink the font to fit the inherited container. A `font-size` change is a layout change: revise line-height and every downstream vertical coordinate that depends on it. For wrapped text, allocate at least the wrapped line count × line-height plus top / bottom padding; fixed `y` stacks copied from a smaller template are invalid once the locked role size is applied. The Executor renders the page it was given; page count and per-page density are the Strategist's call, fixed at confirmation — do **not** re-paginate, split the page, or drop authored content to cope with size here. Only when a single block still cannot fit after the geometry is fully reflowed may you shrink **that block** as a bounded last resort — and **only body text** is ever shrunk this way. Title, subtitle, annotation / caption, footnote and page number are **locked once set and never adjusted to fit** — their values hold across the whole deck. Step the overflowing body block's `font-size` down by `2`px at a time, and only if it still overflows step it down again, up to a cumulative floor of **`4`px below the locked body size** (e.g. `24` → no smaller than `20`). This is a **local, single-block** reduction — the deck-wide locked body size is unchanged on every other block and page. (The Executor works in **unitless px** throughout — spec_lock and SVG carry no `pt`.) If the block still overflows at the floor, surface a `warning:` rather than silently restructure the page. (Mirror templates are the exception: §1.1 preserves their sizes verbatim — there the source deck's typography *is* the spec.)

### 1.1 Mirror-mode templates — reference-style consumption

When the project's chosen template is a `mirror` template (`design_spec.md` frontmatter declares `replication_mode: mirror`), Executor switches to a **reference-style** consumption path that bypasses placeholder substitution:

1. **Per-page reference selection** — Strategist selects one mirror page per project page via `spec_lock.md page_layouts` (e.g., `P04: 015_content`). The basename is the mirror filename without extension; Strategist made this choice by reading `design_spec.md §V Page Roster` descriptions, not by guessing.
2. **Copy, don't fill** — open the referenced mirror SVG (already in context from §1.0). Copy it as the starting point, then edit slide-specific text in place. Preserve every non-text element and every `data-pptx-*` structure attribute verbatim unless adaptive mode intentionally assigns a new Layout contract.
3. **What you may edit** — the visible text content of `<text>` / `<tspan>` elements that express slide-specific content (title, body, captions, KPI labels, dates, page numbers). Replace the source deck's example text with the project's text for this page from `design_spec.md §IX` and `notes/<NN>_*.md`.
4. **What you must not touch** — element positions, sizes, fonts, colors, fills, strokes, gradients, **which image each `<image>` points at**, `<g>` grouping, sprite-sheet `<svg viewBox>` wrappers, decorative `<rect>` / `<path>` / `<circle>` / `<polygon>` shapes, `<use data-icon="...">` markers, embedded chart data structures. Mirror's value is preserving the source deck's visual identity — any geometric / decorative drift defeats the purpose. **The `href` path is not the image**: normalizing a bare `href="cover_bg.png"` to `href="../images/<name>"` (when Step 3 relocated the asset to `images/`) points at the *same* image and changes nothing visual — that is an allowed path fix, not a fidelity edit. Leaving the bare href as-is is also fine; the exporter and live preview resolve bare hrefs against `images/` either way.
5. **Content fit** — the mirror page was chosen by Strategist because its layout matches the content slot. If the project's content for `P<NN>` legitimately needs more / fewer items than the mirror page provides (e.g. mirror shows 3 KPI cards, project has 4 metrics), keep the mirror page's visual rhythm and either drop one metric to fit or split across two pages — do **not** restructure the mirror page's grid. If neither works, surface a `warning: P<NN> content does not fit mirror reference <basename>; suggest different reference page` and proceed with the closest-fit edit.
6. **Visible text editing** — mirror SVGs may keep literal source text rather than `{{...}}` authoring markers. Edit visible text in place, but retain any imported semantic `data-pptx-placeholder` identity.
7. **Output filename** — follow the standard project SVG naming convention (`<NN>_<page_name>.svg` where `<NN>` matches the project page index, not the mirror source index). The mirror filename is the *reference*, not the *output*.

**Detecting mirror mode**: read the chosen template's `design_spec.md` frontmatter once during §1.0 batch read. If `replication_mode: mirror`, every page follows §1.1 through its mandatory `page_layouts` reference.

**Mirror + chart pages**: chart structures inside a mirror SVG are already drawn (axis, series, labels). Treat them as visual references — replace the data labels and series text content to match the project's chart spec, but do not redraw the chart from a `templates/charts/<name>.svg` baseline. A mirror template's `page_charts` entries are normally absent for this reason.

**Legacy fallback table** (used only when `page_layouts` is absent):

| Page Type | Corresponding Template | Adherence Rules |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Cover | `01_cover.svg` | Inherit background, decorative elements, layout structure; replace placeholder content |
| Chapter | `02_chapter.svg` | Inherit numbering style, title position, decorative elements |
| Content | `03_content.svg` | Inherit header/footer styles; **content area may be freely laid out** |
| Ending | `04_ending.svg` | Inherit background, thank-you message position, contact info layout |
| TOC | `02_toc.svg` | **Optional**: Inherit TOC title, list styles |

### Page-Template Mapping Declaration (Required Output)

Before generating each page, output which template is used:

```
📝 **Template mapping**: `templates/03a_content_image_text.svg` (free-design routes may use "None")
🎯 **Adherence rules / layout strategy**: [specific description]
```

- **Content pages**: template defines only header/footer; content area is free
- **No template**: allowed only on free-design or brand-only routes

### 1.2 PowerPoint Master / Layout Mapping

`page_layouts` selects the input SVG prototype and exists only for a deck/layout template route. `pptx_layouts` declares the native PowerPoint Layout produced at export. New baseline and template-distillation routes write the output mapping only after complete SVG pages exist. Legacy immediate-template and preserve routes retain their pre-authored mapping.

`pptx_structure.template_adherence` records the confirmed template-use policy. Both `strict` and `adaptive` require one real `page_layouts` reference per page. With `layout_strategy: distill`, strict restores the referenced contract after design; adaptive may distill a new explicit Layout while retaining the template Master.

| `pptx_structure.mode` | Executor behavior |
|---|---|
| `baseline` | Free design or brand-only route. While `pptx_layouts` is absent, author unconstrained Slide visuals and omit explicit Layout/layer/placeholder metadata. When [`distill-layouts`](../workflows/distill-layouts.md) writes a complete mapping, implement that final contract while remaining in baseline mode. |
| Missing | Legacy compatibility. Use root page role; a new explicit Layout contract also writes `mode: baseline`. |
| `template` | With `layout_strategy: distill`, generate a complete page from the selected `page_layouts` prototype, preserve its structural provenance, and defer the final `pptx_layouts` mapping until post-design distillation. A legacy template lock without the strategy implements its pre-authored mapping immediately. |
| `preserve` | Legacy strict-only compatibility. Use the locked source layout key/name and retain marked preview layers for source-package reuse. |

**Hard rule — every final mapped page references one Layout**: Whenever `pptx_layouts` contains `P<NN>: <layout_key> | <layout name>`, put both values on the root SVG. A distilled row also ends in `| <layout_kind>` and repeats it as `data-pptx-layout-kind`. Baseline accepts `distilled` or `utility`; template distillation accepts only `distilled`. Do not also add `data-pptx-page-role`. Distiller writes post-design identity; Executor must not predict a final adaptive key from the outline.

**Template construction provenance**: While deferred template distillation is pending, copy the selected complete template SVG as the page's visual/structural prototype. Preserve its root key/name provisionally and retain stable direct-child ids plus Master/Layout/placeholder metadata as the design evolves. Do not add `data-pptx-layout-kind` or `pptx_layouts` yet. Strict keeps the structural contract unchanged; adaptive keeps the Master ids/topology/geometry and may evolve the Layout/placeholder contract. Apply the non-mirror skin rules in §1.0. Distillation validates and finalizes these declarations after all visible geometry is complete.

**Free-design carrier hygiene**: While baseline is unmapped, do not add placeholder metadata or default bounds. When the composition permits, keep each likely replaceable atomic title, standalone body frame, or picture in its own top-level one-carrier group, with accents/labels in sibling groups. This satisfies normal grouping while allowing `distill-layouts` to lift the carrier later without dismantling a complex composition; it does not predeclare a Layout or constrain local geometry.

**Hard rule — PowerPoint paint order**: Direct visual children appear in this order: Master background, Layout background, optional Slide background, shared Master shapes, same-key Layout shapes, then slide-local content/placeholders. Backgrounds are the special plane beneath all inherited shapes. Repeat the same Master contract on every page and the same Layout contract on every page sharing a key.

**Mandatory — per-page placeholder coverage**: On every template/pre-authored mapped page, mark each standard slot the page actually has. On a `distilled` page, mark only safe direct atomic carriers chosen from the completed design and give every placeholder explicit `data-pptx-placeholder-bounds`. A `utility` page intentionally has zero placeholders. Pages sharing one layout key ship the same placeholder ids/types/indices/default bounds; their Slide-local geometry may differ.

**Mandatory — reusable layer coverage**: Mark only genuinely stable deck-wide background/chrome as `master` and only reusable behind-content framing as `layout`. A placeholder-only distilled Layout is valid; do not manufacture a divider or panel merely to make the Layout non-empty. A `utility` Layout has neither Layout elements nor placeholders.

**Mandatory — Layout identity**: Different keys differ in reusable static framing or placeholder topology/default bounds. Their current text length, image crop, and Slide-local x/y/width/height never define identity. Identical reusable contracts should share one key; the quality checker reports duplicates.

**Placeholder ownership**: Keep actual title/subtitle/body/picture/chart/table/object/media/date/footer/slide-number content on the Slide and add the matching `data-pptx-placeholder`. In any `distilled` contract, including a deferred template route, the generated Layout owns the reusable placeholder. Atomic carriers retain a matching Slide binding to preserve their approved rendering. A final distilled `object` may instead mark one direct composite `<g>` as a region proxy: that visible group remains ordinary and export creates a hidden transparent matching binding shape. Legacy immediate/pre-authored template contracts retain their historical binding behavior. Do not duplicate placeholder identity with `data-pptx-role`; in particular, `data-pptx-placeholder="slide-number"` already owns page-number field behavior. A reconstructed `title` normally omits `data-pptx-placeholder-idx`; preserve an explicit imported title index when present. Every indexed placeholder on one Layout uses a unique index. Chart/table placeholders require native markers and a later `--native-objects` export; object/media placeholders must each resolve to one top-level DrawingML object unless the final distilled object-region exception applies.

**Atomic placeholder carrier exception**: A normal title/subtitle/body/date/footer/slide-number placeholder is one direct `<text>`; picture/media is one direct `<image>` or imported crop `<svg>`; object is one direct supported atomic object. These direct carriers are the narrow exception to the mandatory top-level `<g>` rule and do not count against the 3–8 content-group budget. The post-design distiller has one additional final-state exception: a direct completed `<g>` may be marked `object` with explicit design-zone bounds when the reusable slot is the whole composition region. It is a Layout-only proxy, not a promise to replace the group in-place, and is forbidden in a reusable template prototype, pending template page, utility page, or legacy immediate contract. The separately specified chart/table native-marker group remains its own specialized contract. Any other complex `<g>` composition stays Slide-local without placeholder metadata.

**Layout-content boundary**: Mark only genuinely reusable static framing as `data-pptx-layer="master|layout"`. Never promote concrete titles, body copy, metrics, chart marks, images, or complex page-specific groups into a Layout. The exporter never infers or clusters. [`distill-layouts`](../workflows/distill-layouts.md) finalizes user-selected baseline pages or every deferred template page before export.

**Adaptive Layout creation**: Start from the selected complete template SVG, keep every Master element and stable id identical, and evolve only the Layout/placeholder contract needed by the completed composition. Do not finalize the new key or default bounds until post-design distillation. An unchanged reusable contract must keep the prototype key/name; changing only its label is not a new Layout. Pages sharing the final key repeat the same static Layout elements and placeholder ids/types/default bounds.

**Deferred template Layout creation**: Keep `page_layouts` as the immutable input-prototype mapping. After every complete page exists, run [`distill-layouts`](../workflows/distill-layouts.md). Strict restores the prototype key/name, Master/Layout ids/topology/geometry, and explicit placeholder bounds. Adaptive validates the Master structure and may finalize a new Layout from the completed design. Project skin remains governed by §1.0. Every template page becomes `distilled`; none becomes `utility`.

**Distilled baseline Layout creation**: Do not derive a native Layout key from §IX before free-design SVG generation. After the user selects completed pages, follow [`distill-layouts`](../workflows/distill-layouts.md): keep visible geometry unchanged, derive default placeholder bounds from design zones rather than text ink, map unselected pages to one empty utility Layout, and write the complete final lock atomically.

**Legacy preserve identity**: In `preserve` mode only, copy source `data-pptx-placeholder-idx` values and retain the source placeholder type/index pairing. Master/Layout preview elements keep `data-pptx-layer` plus `data-pptx-editable="false"`.

**Background ownership**:

| Scope | SVG authoring |
|---|---|
| Deck-wide default | Direct full-canvas solid `<rect data-pptx-layer="master">` repeated identically on every page |
| Page-type default | Direct full-canvas solid `<rect data-pptx-layer="layout">` repeated on every page sharing that layout key |
| One-page exception | Direct full-canvas solid `<rect data-pptx-layer="slide">` |

The exporter writes these solid fills as real Master/Layout/Slide `p:bg`, not selectable full-canvas shapes. Gradients, images, textures, and overlay panels stay explicit shapes unless the shared standard says otherwise.

## 2. Design Parameter Confirmation (Mandatory Step)

Before the first SVG page, output a confirmation listing: canvas dimensions, body font size, color scheme (primary/secondary/accent HEX), font plan, and the live-preview URL reported by the launcher. If the preview launch failed, state that failure before generating SVGs instead of silently proceeding. Prevents spec/execution drift.

### 2.1 Per-page spec_lock re-read (Mandatory)

> Long decks drift off the declared palette/icons mid-deck due to context compression. `spec_lock.md` is the canonical execution reference — re-read it per page to bypass model memory.

**Hard rule**: Before generating **each** SVG page, `read_file <project_path>/spec_lock.md`. Use only values from this file, not from memory. If context was auto-compacted, also `read_file <project_path>/design_spec.md` for the current page's §IX brief.

**Per-block expression**: render each `design_spec.md §IX Content` block in its written texture — a full-sentence block as wrapped prose, a fragment/label block as bullets/keywords. **Never split a full-sentence block into a bullet list** — splitting loses the information that the block was continuous reasoning, not a set of parallel points; not because a bullet lays out easier, and not because an inherited template slot is shaped as a list. If a block carries no clear texture, infer the mode from its wording and the page layout.

- **Prose render recipe**: one `<text>` per paragraph; wrap lines with sibling `<tspan>` where the first line uses `dy="0"` and every subsequent line repeats the parent `<text>`'s **exact `x`** and the **same positive relative `dy`** (the line-height). Equal relative `dy` + matching `x` is what merges the lines into one editable PowerPoint text frame; a growing/cumulative `dy`, an irregular gap, or a mismatched `x` (e.g. `x="0"` under `<text x="60">`) splits them into separate single-line boxes. Set the line-height `dy` from the font size × a line-height factor. **Default — line-height by density (may override per content fit)**: ~1.4–1.5× for dense / small-body blocks (CLReq comfortable minimum), 1.6–2.0× for large-type, sparse, or `breathing` blocks. Fit about width ÷ font-size CJK glyphs per line (Latin fits roughly twice that); the last line runs short. Use the body ramp size, not a new one.
- **Prose reflow contract**: authored rows otherwise export as hard line breaks, so every full-sentence prose block written with the recipe above also declares the explicit paragraph contract — `data-pptx-text-mode="paragraph"` plus `data-pptx-text-bounds="x y w h"` on the `<text>` (the design zone the prose was fitted to; its width becomes the exported wrap width, `y` ≈ `0.9 × font-size` above the first baseline, bottom below the last baseline), and `data-pptx-break="soft"` + `data-pptx-join` (`none` between CJK glyphs, `space` for Latin) on every continuation `<tspan>`. The exported frame then edits as one reflowing paragraph. Do **not** mark titles, verse, quotes, or aligned label stacks — those break positions are design and stay hard. Full recipe and validation rules: [shared-standards.md §4.2](shared-standards.md).
- **Template precedence**: when an inherited template slot is a bullet list but the §IX block is prose, the prose wins — widen or reflow the container to hold the paragraph, or drop that card; do not pour the sentence back into the list slot.
- **Mode precedence**: the locked mode shapes voice / register, not §IX's authored titles or page order. When a `§IX` title is a user-authored topic label, keep it — do not upgrade it to an assertion just because the mode (e.g. `pyramid`) favors them; mode title-tendencies apply only to AI-drafted titles.

> Note: block-level phrasing, applied *within* the page's `page_rhythm` density (below), not against it.

**If `spec_lock.md` is missing**: emit `warning: spec_lock.md missing — generating without execution lock` once, then proceed using `design_spec.md` values. Expected only for legacy projects; new projects MUST have it (see [strategist.md](strategist.md) §6 step 4).

**Forbidden — values outside the lock**:

- Colors (fill / stroke / stop-color) MUST come from `colors`
- Icons MUST come from `icons.inventory`; library MUST equal `icons.library`
- Font family from `typography`: use role override (`title_family` / `body_family` / `emphasis_family` / `code_family`) if declared, else fall back to `font_family`
- Font sizes follow a **ramp anchored on `typography.body`**, not a closed menu. **Structural roles — page title, body, subtitle, annotation / caption, footnote / page number — render at one consistent size deck-wide, taken from their `spec_lock` slot; never re-pick a structural role's size page by page or carry a template's placeholder px.** This locks the **role**, not every glyph: a page may still carry deliberate typographic hierarchy — a lead-in sentence, an inline emphasis figure, a pull-quote, a kicker, a hero number — but each of those is its **own role / feature element** with its own size, **applied consistently deck-wide** (declare a recurring one as its own `spec_lock` slot). In-band intermediate sizes are for exactly these feature elements. What is banned is the *same* role drifting size to fit a container or by page whim — that scatter is what reads as unprofessional. Sizes outside every band require extending the lock first.
- **The page's core message is primary — render it ≥ `body`.** The one-idea / key-claim / key-takeaway line a page is built around is its most important text; map it to the locked `lead` or `subtitle` slot (≥ `body`), never to a sub-`body` size. Demoting it below body while data callouts or labels sit larger inverts the hierarchy — the failure this prevents. If no `lead` / `subtitle` slot is locked for a recurring core-message line, surface it (per below) instead of improvising a smaller one. A footnote / page number / source credit uses the locked `footnote` (or `annotation`) slot — never an invented sub-`annotation` size; and the body-shrink last resort (§1.0) bottoms out at `body − 4`px, a hard floor never crossed.
- **Write the locked px verbatim; at most 2 decimals.** `font-size` MUST be the exact px from `spec_lock.typography` — if `body` is `24`, write `24`; never substitute a "rounder" or PowerPoint-familiar number (`20` / `18` / `36`). The system is px-only — there is no pt to convert, and a remembered pt-style value written as px renders the whole deck the wrong size. Prefer whole numbers (sizes are clean even px); keep a decimal only for a slot that genuinely carries one in `spec_lock`. Never emit long tails like `20.8026`: the exporter rounds the final size to 1 decimal pt, so extra px precision is wasted noise.
- Images MUST reference files listed under `images`; no invented filenames
- Formula PNGs are images with `Acquire Via: formula` / `Status: Rendered`; place them only from the listed file path and never recreate the formula as text.

If a page needs a value not in `spec_lock.md`, surface it — do not silently invent one.

**Per-page layout rhythm — `page_rhythm` section**:

Before drawing each page, look up its entry in `page_rhythm` (key format `P<NN>` matching the page index in §IX of `design_spec.md`) and apply the corresponding layout discipline:

| Tag | Layout discipline |
|-----|-------------------|
| `anchor` | Structural page (cover / chapter / TOC / ending). With a template, follow the matching template verbatim. In free design (no template), realize the page's §IX intent — for the cover deliver its `Cover impact` and for a closing page its `Closing impact` (the committed hook / takeaway + composition), never a default centered title + subtitle or a generic "Thank you" sign-off. |
| `dense` | Information-heavy. Card grids, multi-column layouts, KPI dashboards, tables, and charts are all permitted. This is the baseline behavior. |
| `breathing` | Low-density impact page. Avoid **multi-card grid layouts** — do not organize content as multiple parallel rounded containers (3-card row, 4-card KPI grid, 2×2 matrix rendered as cards). Use naked text blocks, dividers, whitespace, or full-bleed imagery as the content structure. Single rounded visual elements (hero image corners, callouts, tags, one emphasis block) are fine — the rule is about grid structure, not about the `rx` attribute. Proportions follow information weight (not a preset ratio). Typical forms: hero quote, single large number with one-line interpretation, full-bleed image with floating caption, section transition. |

> Without rhythm variation, every page defaults to card grids (the "AI-generated" look). `page_rhythm` is the only narrative lever that survives context compression.

**Missing `page_rhythm` section** → emit `warning: spec_lock.md missing page_rhythm — defaulting all pages to dense` once, fall back to `dense` for all pages.

**Tag not found for current page** → emit `warning: spec_lock.md page_rhythm tag not found for P<NN> — falling back to dense` once per deck (aggregate; do not repeat per page), fall back to `dense`. Do not invent a tag.

**Per-page template lookup — `page_layouts` section**:

Before drawing each page, look up its entry in `page_layouts` to decide which basename to inherit (the SVG itself was loaded in §1.0):

- Entry present (e.g., `P04: 03a_content_image_text`) → inherit the corresponding SVG already in context. The basename **must match** an actual file in the chosen template directory. If it does not, stop before drawing and report the invalid mapping; neither `strict` nor `adaptive` may fall back to free design inside a template deck.
- No entry for this page with `template_adherence: strict|adaptive` → stop before drawing and report the missing Strategist mapping. Adaptive mode still requires one selected complete template SVG; flexibility applies to the post-design output Layout, not to whether an input prototype exists.
- Whole section absent with `pptx_structure.mode: template` → stop before drawing; the current template contract is incomplete.
- Whole section absent only in a legacy project without the current template contract → see §1 fallback (legacy page-type matching).

Do **not** invent a layout entry, and do **not** assume a template just because `templates/` exists. For either template-adherence value, a missing or invalid `page_layouts` row is an upstream contract error. Free design is a separate deck route, never a per-page fallback inside template mode.

**Per-page PowerPoint layout lookup — `pptx_layouts` section**:

- `pptx_structure.mode: baseline` with `layout_strategy: distill` → post-design distillation is complete; a `P<NN>` row and matching root key/name/kind are mandatory. Do not read or create `page_layouts`.
- `pptx_structure.mode: baseline` with `pptx_layouts` but no `layout_strategy` → existing structured-baseline compatibility. A key/name row and matching root metadata are mandatory; do not invent a kind segment.
- `pptx_structure.mode: template` with `layout_strategy: distill` and no `pptx_layouts` → normal template visual construction. Use `page_layouts`, preserve provisional root key/name plus structural provenance, omit root kind, and do not export yet.
- `pptx_structure.mode: template` with `layout_strategy: distill` and complete `pptx_layouts` → post-design distillation is complete; every row/root ends in `distilled` and must pass the selected-prototype comparison.
- `pptx_structure.mode: template` without `layout_strategy`, or `preserve` → legacy immediate/pre-authored behavior; a `P<NN>` row is mandatory. Preserve uses the exact source key/name and placeholder indices.
- `pptx_structure.mode: baseline` with the whole `pptx_layouts` section absent → normal free-design visual construction or undistilled compatibility export. Omit explicit PPTX Layout/layer/placeholder metadata; a root page role may guide conservative compatibility families without constraining composition.
- A layout key may repeat across non-adjacent pages. Reuse is based on identical static/placeholder contracts, not page proximity or content wording.

**Distilled-page scaffold — use only after `distill-layouts`.** It applies to selected baseline pages and every deferred template page. Legacy immediate-template, preserve, and kindless structured-baseline pages do not add `data-pptx-layout-kind` by imitation.

```xml
<svg viewBox="…" data-pptx-layout="<key>" data-pptx-layout-name="<name>"
     data-pptx-layout-kind="distilled">
  <rect id="master-bg" data-pptx-layer="master" …/>              <!-- deck background -->
  <g id="footer-chrome" data-pptx-layer="master" …>…</g>         <!-- every-page chrome -->
  <g id="zone-framing" data-pptx-layer="layout" …>…</g>          <!-- this key's framing -->
  <text id="page-title" data-pptx-placeholder="title"
        data-pptx-placeholder-bounds="60 36 1160 64" …>…</text>
  <text id="main-body" data-pptx-placeholder="body"
        data-pptx-placeholder-idx="1"
        data-pptx-placeholder-bounds="60 120 470 500" …>…</text>
  <image id="hero-image" data-pptx-placeholder="picture"
         data-pptx-placeholder-idx="2"
         data-pptx-placeholder-bounds="570 120 650 500" …/>
  <text id="page-number" data-pptx-placeholder="slide-number"
        data-pptx-placeholder-idx="3"
        data-pptx-placeholder-bounds="1170 670 50 24" …>…</text>
  <g id="content-block-1">…</g>                                  <!-- 3–8 content groups -->
  <g id="content-block-2">…</g>
</svg>
```

Master/layout layers and placeholders are always direct children of the root and precede every content group; a placeholder written inside a content `<g>` fails export.

**Per-page chart reference — `page_charts` section**:

Before drawing each page, look up its entry in `page_charts` to decide which chart structure applies (the SVG itself was loaded in §1.0):

- Entry present (e.g., `P09: timeline_horizontal`) → adapt the corresponding chart SVG already in context. Apply project colors/typography/density; do not copy verbatim. Cross-reference `templates/charts/charts_index.json` for the chart's purpose summary if needed.
- No entry for this page → either no chart on this page, or a chart that didn't match any catalog template (Strategist's `no-template-match` fallback). Design the visualization from scratch using `design_spec.md §VII` for guidance.
- Whole section absent → no chart pages in this deck.

---

## 3. Execution Guidelines

- **Proximity**: group related elements with tight spacing; separate unrelated groups
- **Element grouping (Mandatory)**: wrap every logical content unit — title, core-message line, each content block, card, list item, diagram, and footer chrome — in a top-level `<g id="...">` with a descriptive id. This is a hard requirement per [`shared-standards.md`](shared-standards.md) §4.3, not an optional convenience: aim for 3–8 content groups per slide (chrome excluded), because ungrouped top-level `<text>` / `<rect>` / `<path>` loses real PowerPoint groups and per-element animation anchors, and degrades select/move/edit. The narrow exception is one direct atomic carrier with `data-pptx-placeholder` under §1.2: it stays ungrouped so one native object can supply the Layout prototype or pre-authored Slide binding, and it is excluded from the group budget. Only the post-design distiller may additionally mark one completed top-level group as a final `distilled` object-region proxy; authoring-time template and legacy routes cannot imitate it. Authored native preset fragments (`preset_shape_svg.py`) already are one atomic `<g id>` each and count as one group; keep their labels in a sibling parent `<g>`.
- **Spec adherence**: follow color, layout, canvas format, and typography in the spec
- **Template structure**: if templates exist, inherit the visual framework
- **Main-agent ownership**: SVG generation must run in the main agent (not sub-agents) — pages share upstream context for cross-page visual continuity
- **Generation rhythm**: lock global design context first, then generate pages sequentially in one continuous context. No batched groups (e.g., 5 at a time).
- **Default — stage each page with the style's composition geometry (may override when the content genuinely calls for a plain grid)**: an SVG page is a canvas, not a DOM. Before defaulting to stacked rounded-rect cards or uniform equal columns, pick one page-scale move from the locked visual style's §1 `Composition geometry` (a bleed shape, diagonal split, oversized numeral, orbit rings, …) to stage the page's primary zone. Card grids are one option among many, not the house layout.
- **Reference — image-led promotional pages (not a constraint)**: for travel, venue, product-introduction, hospitality, event, real-estate, and brochure-style decks, let images define the page skeleton before placing text. Consult [`image-layout-patterns.md`](image-layout-patterns.md) §Imported Deck Patterns and prefer patterns such as `#74` TOC image-navigation cards, `#75` asymmetric chapter banners, `#77` photo mosaic with a text cell, `#78` ambient banner + evidence photo + text panel, `#79` ribbon-header image cards, and `#80` side hero image + staggered evidence cards before falling back to plain left/right image-text splits.
- **Phased batch generation** (recommended):
  1. **Visual Construction Phase**: generate all SVG pages sequentially for visual consistency. Use layout judgment for chart marks during the draft. **MUST embed plot-area markers** per §3.1 below on every chart page — coordinate calibration is a post-generation step (see [`workflows/verify-charts.md`](../workflows/verify-charts.md)) that depends on these markers — and **native object metadata** per §3.2 on every eligible data-chart page. **First-page gate (Mandatory)**: after completing the first page, run `python3 scripts/svg_quality_checker.py <project_path>/svg_output/<first_page>.svg` and fix every error before drawing page 2 — structural violations are systematic, and a first-page error repeated deck-wide costs a whole-deck rewrite.
  2. **Quality Check Gate**: run `python3 scripts/svg_quality_checker.py <project_path>` on `svg_output/`. Any `error` (banned features, viewBox mismatch, spec_lock drift, non-PPT-safe font, etc.) MUST be fixed on the offending page before proceeding — regenerate and re-check. Address `warning`s when straightforward. Do NOT defer to after `finalize_svg.py` — finalize rewrites SVG and masks some violations.
  3. **Logic Construction Phase**: after SVGs pass the quality check, batch-generate speaker notes for narrative continuity.

### 3.0 Native Preset Shape Selection

**Reach for a native preset whenever one expresses a complete object — this is
the default, not the exception.** Block arrows, chevrons, banners / ribbons,
callouts, flowchart nodes, stars, and other Office symbols should be **authored
as presets** via `preset_shape_svg.py`, not drawn as plain `<path>`s or faked
with rectangles: presets are what give the slide real PowerPoint shapes with
adjustment handles and the designed, non-flat-card look. When a page calls for
one of these, use the preset. Apply the decision gate in
[`native-shape-authoring.md`](./native-shape-authoring.md) to pick the right
shape and to keep only the exceptions below as ordinary SVG.

| Decision | Action |
|---|---|
| Plain rect / symmetric round rect / circle / ellipse | Keep the ordinary SVG primitive; it is already natively editable. |
| Exact single-preset match | Call `preset_shape_svg.py render` and paste its complete stdout fragment into the current hand-authored SVG. |
| Page-specific, compound, organic, branded, icon, or data geometry | Keep ordinary SVG path/polygon geometry. |
| Similar-looking contour only | Never guess; keep ordinary SVG. |

This automatic decision applies only before drawing a new object. Do not scan
existing SVG, classify path contours, or upgrade ordinary SVG during export.

**Hard rule**: do not hand-write `data-pptx-authoring`, `data-pptx-prst`,
`data-pptx-frame`, adjustment, carrier, preview, or fingerprint metadata. The
helper generates them atomically from the shared 187-shape registry. Rerun the
helper when geometry or paint changes.

Connector-family presets require `--object-kind connector`, `fill="none"`, and
a visible stroke. They export as unconnected `p:cxnSp`; do not hand-add
endpoint/site metadata. `actionButton*` presets provide visual geometry only,
not actions or hyperlinks.

**Hard rule — narrow helper scope**: the helper prints one shape fragment to
stdout. It does not write a page or choose layout. Read the fragment and insert
it through the normal `apply_patch` page edit; never redirect, loop, or batch it
into `svg_output/`.

### 3.1 Chart Plot-Area Marker (MANDATORY on every chart page)

> The [`verify-charts`](../workflows/verify-charts.md) workflow enumerates chart pages from `design_spec.md §VII`, then reads each page's plot-area marker to feed `svg_position_calculator.py`. Missing marker → verify-charts has to re-derive the plot area from axis lines, paying the cost on every run.

**Hard rule**: every SVG page that contains a data visualization chart includes a plot-area marker inside `<g id="chartArea">`, placed **after axis lines** and **before the first data element** (bar, line, area, point).

**Rectangular plot area** (bar / horizontal_bar / grouped_bar / stacked_bar / line / area / stacked_area / scatter / waterfall / pareto / butterfly):

```xml
<!-- chart-plot-area: x_min,y_min,x_max,y_max -->
```

**Radial charts** (pie / donut / radar):

```xml
<!-- chart-plot-area: pie | center: cx,cy | radius: r -->
<!-- chart-plot-area: donut | center: cx,cy | outer-radius: r1 | inner-radius: r2 -->
<!-- chart-plot-area: radar | center: cx,cy | radius: r -->
```

**How to determine coordinate values**:

| Value | Derivation |
|-------|------------|
| `x_min` | X coordinate of the Y-axis line (leftmost data boundary) |
| `y_min` | Y coordinate of the topmost grid line (highest data boundary) |
| `x_max` | X coordinate of the rightmost axis endpoint or grid line |
| `y_max` | Y coordinate of the X-axis baseline |
| `cx, cy` | Center point of pie/donut/radar (accounting for `transform="translate()"`) |
| `r` | Outer radius of the chart |

**Per-page verification** — after writing each chart SVG, confirm the marker exists:

```bash
grep "chart-plot-area" <project_path>/svg_output/<current_page>.svg
```

> All chart templates in `templates/charts/` include this marker as a reference. If you are drawing a chart and the marker is absent, you have a bug.
- **Technical specs**: see [shared-standards.md](shared-standards.md) for SVG/PPT constraints
- **Card containers — use the documented patterns**: when a content page needs section cards (4 quadrants, parallel aspects, capability blocks, info cards), use the patterns codified in [`templates/charts/CHART_STYLE_GUIDE.md`](../templates/charts/CHART_STYLE_GUIDE.md) §11 — half-rounded section tab (§11.1), nested card border without stroke (§11.2), card-grid skeletons (§11.3), diagonal dashed connector for cross-quadrant relationships (§11.5), ground-anchor ellipse as a non-filter depth marker (§11.6), bidirectional interaction arrows for paired protocols (§11.7). Do not reinvent the "tinted full-rounded rect + white cover-rect to hide the bottom corners" hack; it survives in older templates but breaks SVG→PPTX color editing. Reference templates: [`labeled_card.svg`](../templates/charts/labeled_card.svg), [`quadrant_text_bullets.svg`](../templates/charts/quadrant_text_bullets.svg), [`kpi_cards.svg`](../templates/charts/kpi_cards.svg), [`matrix_2x2.svg`](../templates/charts/matrix_2x2.svg), [`team_roster.svg`](../templates/charts/team_roster.svg), [`client_server_flow.svg`](../templates/charts/client_server_flow.svg).
- **Reference — prefer semantic shapes over preset stacks (not a constraint)**: when a slide needs to express "ascending / converging / breaking through / stacking" — i.e., a relationship that goes beyond a generic arrow — prefer a single custom `<polygon>` or `<path>` that encodes the semantics geometrically, rather than stacking multiple preset arrows. A converging-tip path or a podium polygon reads faster than three arrows pointing at a label. Examples of this technique appear in many imported corporate decks; see `projects/01_template_import/svg_output/slide_01.svg` shape-158 for a reference (gradient-filled inward-pointing arrow). Do not codify these as templates — they are page-specific; the rule is just "consider polygon before stacking presets."
- **Reference — visual depth through restraint (not a constraint)**: layered depth comes from rhythm (flat vs lifted, dense vs spacious), not from shadows everywhere. Shadow typically suits 2-3 genuinely floating elements per page (cards on photos, primary CTA, overlays); keep peer-grid cards, dividers, body containers flat. Reach for typography weight, spacing, accent bars, subtle tints **before** shadow.

### 3.2 Native Object Metadata Marker (MANDATORY on eligible data-chart and text-grid table pages)

> `svg_to_pptx.py --native-objects` converts marked groups into real PowerPoint chart/table objects (charts get an embedded Excel workbook). Markers stay dormant in the default export — pages render from their SVG children — but a deck without markers can never form native objects. Write the marker at draw time: the data is already in hand, and recovering it later costs a full re-read pass.

**Hard rule**: every data chart whose type appears in the **Supported chart types** list of [shared-standards.md](shared-standards.md) "Native PPTX Table / Chart Markers" (the single authority for the eligible set, marker contract, and JSON schemas) gets `data-pptx-native="chart"` plus a `<metadata data-pptx-native="chart">` JSON child on its top-level `<g>`, transcribing the same data just plotted. Every pure text-grid data table gets `data-pptx-native="table"` the same way, transcribing all visible cell text into `columns` / `rows`.

- Chart types absent from that list and conceptual/diagrammatic graphics (process flows, cycles, quadrant cards, timelines, KPI cards) get **no marker** — `svg_quality_checker.py` rejects unsupported marker types.
- Canonical rectangular merged text cells may carry a table marker by putting anchor-only `row_span` / `col_span` in metadata and leaving covered cells blank. Nonrectangular/overlapping merges, nonblank covered cells, and graphical cells (icons, harvey balls, rating dots) get **no table marker** and stay on the SVG fallback route.
- Transcribe, don't restyle: `categories` / `series[].values` are the numbers just plotted; `style.colors` carries the series HEX values already used on the page (from `spec_lock.colors`).
- Data-point color: when a single column/bar series uses data-point colors in the fallback, copy those fills into `series[].point_colors` in category order.
- Data labels: when visible point values are part of the fallback chart, write `data_labels` instead of companion text; use `data_labels.points` for selected labels, and use `number_format`, `font_size`, `font_family`, and per-point `colors` / `color` when the fallback labels carry suffixes or color-coded text.
- Line markers: when the fallback line chart draws visible point nodes, set `line_style: "lineMarker"`; leave the default `line` only for line charts without nodes.
- Area-under-line: when a combo plot is drawn as a filled area under a line, keep `type: "line"`, add `area_fill: true`, and copy the area transparency into `series[].fill_opacity`; copy visible line `stroke-width` into `series[].line_width` for line/area series.
- Native chrome: write `title`, `subtitle`, axis titles, or `show_legend: true` only when the fallback visibly renders the same chrome inside the native chart's replacement scope. `title` is the PowerPoint chart title, not an object name; use `name` for page-semantic object naming (e.g. `p03-revenue-chart`). Write explicit `x`/`y`/`width`/`height` read from the drawn plot area; omission is the fallback — the exporter then infers the frame from the drawn fallback geometry.
- Value-axis labels: when the fallback keeps category labels but intentionally omits numeric value-axis tick labels, set `show_value_axis_labels: false`.
- Freeform chart text: transcribe center labels, source notes, and other in-chart annotations as companion `caption` / `note` / `notes` entries with explicit slide-coordinate bounds; do not rely on fallback `<text>` children to survive native export.
- Native chart typography mirrors the SVG fallback. Copy the fallback's shared chart font into `style.font_family` and visible chart text sizes into the matching metadata fields (`title_font_size`, `subtitle_font_size`, `axis_font_size`, `note_font_size`, etc.) only when role sizes differ; otherwise let the exporter infer them from visible fallback text. When a visible chart title, subtitle, or axis title needs its own size/color/font, write that field as an object with `text`, `font_size`, `font_family`, and `color`. Use `axis_title_font_size`, `legend_font_size`, or companion per-entry `font_size` only when the fallback visibly uses a separate size.
- Native table typography mirrors the SVG fallback. Write `style.font_family` and `style.font_size` from the visible table text; use `header_font_size` or per-cell `font_size` only when the fallback visibly does so. If the fallback has no explicit table font, fall back to the deck body family and locked body size from `spec_lock.md typography`.
- The marker group's transform stays translate/scale only (no rotate / matrix / skew).
- Visual parity is not a goal: the SVG drawing remains the designed visual; the native object is a data-editable counterpart with PowerPoint-default styling that users restyle by hand after export. Never simplify the SVG design to match what a native object could show.

**Per-page verification** — after writing each eligible data-chart or text-grid table page, confirm the marker exists:

```bash
grep "data-pptx-native" <project_path>/svg_output/<current_page>.svg
```

### SVG File Naming Convention

Format: `<NN>_<page_name>.svg` (two-digit number from 01; name matches the deck's language and the page title in the Design Spec).

Examples: `01_封面.svg` / `02_目录.svg` / `03_核心优势.svg`; `01_cover.svg` / `02_agenda.svg` / `03_key_benefits.svg`.

## 4. Icon Usage

Strategist chooses the library and inventory; Executor only implements. Library details and one-library rule: [`../templates/icons/README.md`](../templates/icons/README.md). This section defines placeholder syntax.

> **Resolution is project-first.** Strategist copied the chosen icons into `<project_path>/icons/<lib>/` (via `icon_sync.py`); `finalize_svg.py embed-icons` embeds from there, falling back to the global library per-icon. **Custom icons**: drop an `.svg` into `<project_path>/icons/<lib>/` (any `<lib>`, e.g. `custom/`) and reference it as `data-icon="<lib>/<name>"` — it embeds like any other. Reference only icons in the `spec_lock.md` inventory.

**Built-in icons — Placeholder method (recommended)**:

```xml
<!-- chunk-filled (straight-line geometry, sharp corners, structured) -->
<use data-icon="chunk-filled/home" x="100" y="200" width="48" height="48" fill="#005587"/>

<!-- tabler-filled (bezier-curve forms, smooth & rounded contours) -->
<use data-icon="tabler-filled/home" x="100" y="200" width="48" height="48" fill="#005587"/>

<!-- tabler-outline (light, line-art style — screen-only decks) -->
<use data-icon="tabler-outline/home" x="100" y="200" width="48" height="48" fill="#005587"/>

<!-- phosphor-duotone (single color + 20% backplate — soft depth without solid weight) -->
<use data-icon="phosphor-duotone/house" x="100" y="200" width="48" height="48" fill="#005587"/>

<!-- simple-icons (brand logos — used alongside the deck's primary library, only for real company/product marks) -->
<use data-icon="simple-icons/github" x="100" y="200" width="48" height="48" fill="#181717"/>

<!-- tabler-outline with thin / bold stroke (stroke-style libraries only) -->
<use data-icon="tabler-outline/home" x="100" y="200" width="48" height="48" fill="#005587" stroke-width="1.5"/>
<use data-icon="tabler-outline/home" x="100" y="200" width="48" height="48" fill="#005587" stroke-width="3"/>
```

> ⚠️ **Color**: ALWAYS use `fill="#HEX"` on `<use data-icon="...">`. NEVER use `stroke` or `fill="none"`, even for stroke-style libraries.
>
> **stroke-width** (stroke-style libraries only, currently `tabler-outline`): allowed values `{1.5, 2, 3}`. If `spec_lock.md icons.stroke_width` is declared, all placeholders MUST use that value deck-wide. Default `2` if absent (legacy). Ignored on non-stroke libraries.
>
> Icons are auto-embedded by `finalize_svg.py` — no need to run `embed_icons.py` manually.

**Searching for icons** — use terminal, zero token cost:
```bash
ls skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/chunk-filled/ | grep home
ls skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/tabler-filled/ | grep home
ls skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/tabler-outline/ | grep chart
ls skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/phosphor-duotone/ | grep house
ls skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/simple-icons/ | grep github
```

**Abstract concept → icon name** (names for `chunk-filled`; tabler libraries use their own equivalents — verify with `ls | grep`):

| Concept | chunk-filled | tabler-filled / tabler-outline |
|---------|-------|-------------------------------|
| Growth / Increase | `arrow-trend-up` | same |
| Decline / Decrease | `arrow-trend-down` | same |
| Success / Complete | `circle-checkmark` | `circle-check` |
| Warning / Risk | `triangle-exclamation` | `alert-triangle` |
| Innovation / Idea | `lightbulb` | `bulb` |
| Strategy / Goal | `target` | same |
| Efficiency / Speed | `bolt` | same |
| Collaboration / Team | `users` | same |
| Settings / Config | `cog` | `settings` |
| Security / Trust | `shield` | same |
| Money / Finance | `dollar` | `currency-dollar` |
| Time / Deadline | `clock` | same |
| Location / Region | `map-pin` | same |
| Communication | `comment` | `message` |
| Analysis / Data | `chart-bar` | same |
| Process / Flow | `arrows-rotate-clockwise` | `refresh` |
| Global / World | `globe` | `world` |
| Excellence / Award | `star` | same |
| Expand / Scale | `maximize` | same |
| Problem / Issue | `bug` | same |

> For self-evident names (home, user, file, search, arrow, etc.) — just `grep chunk-filled/` directly without consulting the table.

> ⚠️ **Icon validation**: only use icons from the Design Spec's approved inventory. Verify each via `ls | grep` before use. Mixing libraries within one deck is FORBIDDEN.

---

## 5. Visualization Reference

Chart SVGs referenced in **VII. Visualization Reference List** are loaded once via the §1.0 batch read. This section governs adaptation only.

**Hard rule**: adapt the loaded chart SVG; do not improvise from memory and do not replicate verbatim. Apply project colors, typography, content; preserve visualization type.

**Adaptation rules**:
- **Preserve**: visualization type (bar/line/pie/timeline/process/framework…) as specified
- **Adapt**: data, labels, colors (project scheme), dimensions
- **Freely adjust**: composition, axis ranges, grid, legend, spacing, decoration — as long as the chart stays accurate and readable
- **Forbidden**: changing visualization type without spec justification; omitting data points or structural elements from the outline

> Templates: `templates/charts/` (76 types). Index: `templates/charts/charts_index.json`

### 5.1 Chart Coordinate Calibration

Coordinate calibration runs as a **standalone post-generation workflow**, not inside the executor pipeline. After SVG generation completes, if the deck contains data charts, run [`workflows/verify-charts.md`](../workflows/verify-charts.md) before post-processing.

The executor's only obligation here is upstream: embed the `<!-- chart-plot-area ... -->` marker on every chart page during initial draft (§3.1). Verify-charts enumerates chart pages from `design_spec.md §VII` (authoritative deck plan) and uses the marker to feed `svg_position_calculator.py`.

> Do NOT run `svg_position_calculator.py` during the initial draft. The calculator calibrates already-generated SVGs against their declared plot areas; running it before the SVG exists has nothing to compare against.

---

## 6. Image Handling

Handle images by their status in the Design Spec's Image Resource List. Status enum and lifecycle: [`svg-image-embedding.md`](svg-image-embedding.md).

| Status | Source | Handling |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Existing** | User-provided | Reference images directly from `../images/` directory |
| **Generated** | Generated by Image_Generator | Reference images directly from `../images/` directory |
| **Sourced** | Web-acquired by Image_Searcher | Reference from `../images/`. **Read [`image_sources.json`](image-searcher.md) to decide attribution** — see §6.1 below. |
| **Rendered** | Deterministic formula PNG | Reference from `../images/`; use `preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet"` |
| **Needs-Manual** | Acquisition failed and file is absent | Use dashed border placeholder unless the expected file exists |
| **Placeholder** | Not yet prepared | Use dashed border placeholder |

**Reference syntax**: see [`svg-image-embedding.md`](svg-image-embedding.md).

**Template-bundled images**: when a template (deck / layout / brand) is applied, its bitmaps are copied into the project's `images/` alongside every other runtime image (SKILL.md Step 3). Reference them the same way — `../images/<name>` — and do **not** reproduce a template SVG's bare sibling href (e.g. `href="cover_bg.png"`): the template SVG is reference material, the rendered page lives in `svg_output/` and must point at `../images/`. Mirror templates (§1.1) are the one exception — they copy hrefs verbatim, and the exporter resolves those bare hrefs against `images/`.

**Placeholder**: Dashed border `<rect stroke-dasharray="8,4" .../>` + description text

**`no-crop` images**: when a `spec_lock.md images` entry ends with ` | no-crop`, size the container to the image's native ratio (from `analyze_images.py` or file dims) and use `preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet"`. Untagged entries are croppable — default to `slice`.

**Formula images**: rows with `Acquire Via: formula` or `Type: Latex Formula` MUST be treated as no-crop even if a legacy `spec_lock.md` forgot the flag. Use the dimensions from `design_spec.md §VIII`, `analysis/image_analysis.csv`, or `images/formula_manifest.json`; do not normalize all formulas to one height unless the spec explicitly states that layout choice.

### 6.1 Inline Attribution for Sourced Images (web path)

Whenever the slide uses an image with `Status: Sourced`, look up the corresponding entry in `project/images/image_sources.json` and act on `license_tier`:

| `license_tier` | Action on this slide |
|---|---|
| `no-attribution` | Embed the `<image>` element only. **No credit element needed.** |
| `attribution-required` | Embed the `<image>` element **plus** a small inline `<text>` credit element per the visual spec in [image-searcher.md §7](./image-searcher.md). |
| `manual` | Embed the `<image>` element only. **No credit element** — a user-supplied `--from-url` replacement; verifying usage rights / any required credit is the user's responsibility. |

The credit text is **not** rendered by post-processing or export — it must be present in the SVG you produce. The shape of the credit element (size, position, color, multi-image source line, hero gradient overlay) is specified in [image-searcher.md §7](./image-searcher.md). Do not invent a different style.

Use `attribution_text` from the manifest entry as the **starting point**, then compress for the small-text constraint (drop URL, drop filename, keep "via Provider / License"). For CC0/PD images that landed in the `attribution-required` tier only because of upstream metadata quirks (rare), credits are still safe to render.

`svg_quality_checker.py` treats missing CC BY / CC BY-SA inline attribution as an **error**. Fix the offending SVG before post-processing.

**The manifest is the single source of truth for credits.** Do not duplicate license info into speaker notes or any other artifact.

## 7. Font Usage

Source of truth: `spec_lock.md typography`. Use `font_family` as default; override per role with `title_family` / `body_family` / `emphasis_family` / `code_family` if declared. LaTeX formulas that Strategist rendered are PNG images, not a `code_family` text role.

If `spec_lock.md` is absent, consult [`strategist.md`](strategist.md) §g — do not invent a stack.

**Hard rule**: every SVG `font-family` stack MUST resolve to pre-installed exported Latin / EA typefaces (Microsoft YaHei / SimHei / SimSun / Arial / Calibri / Segoe UI / Times New Roman / Georgia / Consolas / Courier New / Impact / Arial Black). PPTX has no runtime fallback — missing fonts degrade to Calibri.

## 8. Speaker Notes Generation Framework

### Task 1. Generate Complete Speaker Notes Document

After all SVG pages are finalized, enter Logic Construction Phase and write the full notes to `notes/total.md`. Batch-writing (not per-page) lets transitions plan coherently.

**Pure spoken narration**: notes are read aloud verbatim by `notes_to_audio.py` (TTS). Write only what should be spoken. No visible markers, no labeled meta-lines, no enumerated key-point lists, no duration annotations — anything you write outside the heading will be vocalized.

**Per-page structure**: `# <number>_<page_title>` heading (the `#` heading line is the only thing stripped before TTS), pages separated by `---`. Body is 2–5 natural sentences carrying the page's core message. Page-to-page transitions live inside the opening sentence as natural prose ("接下来……" / "Having framed X, let's turn to Y") — no bracketed `[过渡]` / `[Transition]` tags.

**Concrete examples** — same shape applies to any language; just write naturally in that language.

# 02_市场格局

在明确了行业背景之后，我们来看具体的市场格局。当前线上零售集中度持续上升，前三大平台合计份额已经达到百分之六十八，腰部玩家正在被快速挤压，留给新进入者的窗口期不超过十八个月。这意味着我们的策略必须聚焦，而不是铺开。

# 02_market_landscape

Having framed the industry backdrop, let's look at the actual market landscape. Online retail concentration keeps rising — the top three platforms now hold sixty-eight percent of combined share, mid-tier players are being squeezed fast, and the window for new entrants is under eighteen months. This means our strategy has to focus, not spread.

**Number readability**: TTS reads digits and symbols literally. Prefer fully-spelled forms in the language being spoken when literal pronunciation would be awkward (e.g. Chinese "百分之六十八" reads better than "68%"; "1-2分钟" reads as "一减二分钟"). Plain integers and percentages in English are fine as-is.

**Common mistakes to avoid**:
- Leaving any bracketed stage marker (`[过渡]` / `[Transition]` / `[Pause]` / `[Data]` / `[Scan Room]` / `[Interactive]` / `[Benchmark]` etc.) in the text — they will be read aloud literally.
- Adding `要点：① …` / `Key points: (1) …` / `时长：2分钟` / `Duration: 2 minutes` / `Flex: …` lines — TTS will speak "要点 一 …".
- Mixing languages within one deck's notes.

### Task 2. Split Into Per-Page Note Files

Auto-split `notes/total.md` into per-page files in `notes/`.

**Naming**: match SVG names (`01_cover.svg` → `notes/01_cover.md`); `slide01.md` also supported (legacy).

## 9. Next Steps After Completion

> **Auto-continuation**: After Visual Construction Phase (all SVG pages) and Logic Construction Phase (all notes) are complete, the Executor proceeds directly to the post-processing pipeline.

**Post-processing & Export** (canonical workflow: [`SKILL.md` Step 7](../SKILL.md)):

```bash
# 1. Split speaker notes
python3 scripts/total_md_split.py <project_path>

# 2. SVG post-processing (auto-embed icons/images and flatten positioned text)
python3 scripts/finalize_svg.py <project_path>
# Output: svg_final/ self-contained SVG visual previews

# 3. Export PPTX
python3 scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project_path>
# Output (default-flow mode):
#   exports/<project_name>_<timestamp>.pptx           ← native pptx (canonical output)
#   backup/<timestamp>/svg_output/                    ← Executor SVG source backup (always written)
```

`svg_final/` may be opened directly or manually inserted into PowerPoint as an SVG picture. It is not a second PPTX route. Use `-s final` only for converter diagnostics; release exports use the default `svg_output/` source. Manual Convert-to-Shape behavior is unsupported.
